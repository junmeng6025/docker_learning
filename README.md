```
then give the password

# 2. Utils with Linux
Usually there is no more graphical UI available to access files & folders when you work with workstation via your local terminal. All should be execuetd with linux commands. There're some utils that can make your work easier and more efficient:

| func                     | app                       |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------- |
| Multi window             | [tmux](tmux.md)           |
| Editing                  | [vim](vim.md)           |
| Copy / move files around | [linux_cmd](linux_cmd.md) |
| Dev env                  | [Docker](docker.md)       |
| View hardware usage      | `htop`                    |
